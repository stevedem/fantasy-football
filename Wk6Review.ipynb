    "# Week 6 Fantasy Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright gents, another week in the book. For those of you unaware, you are reading the prose of our first '18-'19 season's two-time poster. Let me tell you; it is a miraculous and magical feeling. I was a bit concerned the past few weeks when my team decided to collectively shit the bed but with concerns regarding my fantasy performance repealing, let's get a data-driven look at Week 6 in fantasy land.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gonna take a different, albeit equitable, perspective of last week's pigskin matches. Clearly, the name of the game in fantasy is to assemble a squad of heads that put up numbers week to week. But realistically, a single player's performance can depend *so heavily* on the other players on the field. And for that reason, I'm going to look at the total offensive production of the NFL from Week 6. Dive into the numbers. Do the `data` thing. Ja feel?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sidebar:** *I thought I'd be able to do a lot more with the data. But the teams names didn't align. I don't have the specific stats for each player from Yahoo. In all fairness anyone that posted after Butson's masterpiece was going to fall short, so might as well add to that diasappointment.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick plug for my bo**Y** Buston. Knocked it out of the park last week with the freestyle post. Refined disses, production-level quality and dutiful attention to detail are things we can all get behind. Collectively as a fantasy league, this season marks a graduation or emergence of sorts when looking at the coveted weekly post."

Assemble a squad that takes the largest percentage of offensive production from each of the most productive offenses in the NFL and you've got a championship game on your horizon."
